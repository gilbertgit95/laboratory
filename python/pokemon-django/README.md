# pokemon-django
pokemon app base on the free pokeapi, implemented on django framework


## setup
just run pipenv setup commands to initialise environment and dependencies, and migration scripts for the database.


then run:
```python manage.py initcontent```
this script may take minutes to finish, because of the source limitation. The script will populate the empty database.


After the setup, you can now run the app, and it should work fine..
